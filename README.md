# Shecodes Basics Workshop

This repository contains code for the exercises I completed during the SheCodes Basics Workshop.

Key skills I acquired during the workshop include:
* Building an interactive web page
* Using VSCode for web development
* Understanding the basics of HTML and HTML elements
* Styling HTML pages with CSS
* Creating basic JavaScript functions

For my final project, I created the landing page for a website that introduces chaos theory, available here: [Basics Final Project](https://www.shecodes.io/cohorts/shecodes-basics-0ecb1ade-6170-40b2-9236-4676ab7260c5/projects/1948739)
